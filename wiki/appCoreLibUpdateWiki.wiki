== update 2008.02.20 ==

Added a new class: ClassUtil.  ClassUtil contains methods to translate generic objects to specific class types.  Hopefully not too many folks have been using ObjectUtil just yet so this should affect very few of you.  If so, you can still continue to use ObjectUtil for awhile until I can finally remove it.
  
  * deprecated ObjectUtil (use ClassUtil instead)
  * added ClassUtil

== update 2007.12.28 ==

I am currently having issues with my asdoc compiler.  So right now there are no docs.  I am working to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.  All the source code has asdoc comments in it.  I will also be uploading an example file.
